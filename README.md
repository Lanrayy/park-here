# park-here
The repository for the park here image recognition project.

###Brief
Every year drivers pay 1.2 bn in parking fines in the UK every year which is £39 per driver
UK drivers also pay £1.2 billion annually in parking fines.

These parking fines arise from either, not being able to properly understand parking signs or overstaying in parking bays.
The park here app will attempt to solve both of these problems.

The app wll have multiple features, including:-

- Camera mode - point the camera at a parking sign, and it will tell you weather or not you can park there.
- Time mode - After parking, the app will automatically set a timer to let you know how long you can keep parking at your space.
- Location mode - I suspect this will be the most difficult to implement and also the most inaccurate 
    - it will involve using a users' location to detect whether they can park in a particular location.
    
###The project
This project is the starting point of the park here app. I will be exploring optical character recognition with python.
The app wil read the text on a parking sign, interpret it and give you a definitive answer on whether you can park there or not based on time and vehicle type.
